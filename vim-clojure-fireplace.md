# Shotcut for Clojure programming with Vim / Fireplace / Lein

Open a terminal in your project directory an run: **lein repl**

* **:Connect** - Fireplace should auto-connect (when you run _lein repl_, it creates the file target/repl-port) and the Fireplace plugin uses this to connect to the server.
